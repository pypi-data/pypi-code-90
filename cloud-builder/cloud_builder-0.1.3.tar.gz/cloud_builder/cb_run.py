    cb-run - builds packages by calling the run.sh script
    which must be present in the given root_path. cb-run
    is usually called after cb-prepare which creates an
    environment to satisfy the cb-run requirements

    The called run.sh script is expected to run a program
    that builds packages and stores them below the path
    returned by Defaults.get_runner_results_root()

    If the OBS build script is used this will be the
    following directory lookup:

    root_path
    └── home
        └── abuild

    At the end of cb-run an information record will be send
